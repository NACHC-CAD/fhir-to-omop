Introduction
============
The fhir-to-omop project started as an initial effort to map FHIR data to OMOP data.  This project grew into a series of tools that includes mapping FHIR to OMOP but also includes a suite of tools designed to address many of the common tasks associated with both FHIR and OMOP.  All of the tools here are publicly available under the Apache 2 license. Documentation for this project is available <a href="https://nachc-cad.github.io/fhir-to-omop/index.html">here</a>.  Our getting started guide is available <a href="https://nachc-cad.github.io/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/StartHere.html">here</a>.  This page also includes the <a href="https://nachc-cad.github.io/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/StartHere.html">prerequisites</a> required for the fhir-to-omop tools.  These tools were developed and tested in a Windows environment but should be runnable anywhere as they are all written in Java.  There are some convenience files that make running these tools easier on Windows (e.g. .bat files). These tools have been developed and tested using MS Sql Server.
