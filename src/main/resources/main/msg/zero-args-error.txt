# WELCOME TO fhir-on-omop
# --------------------------

You've successfully launched the fhir-to-omop application!
However, we need at least one correct parameter, the name of the module you would like to run.  
The following options are valid:

	say-hello
		Echo the string "Hello world!" back to the console.
	params-example
		Displays an example of what the parameters file should look like.
	my-params
		Shows the parameters that the application has found for your request.  
		In other words, this echos the parameters you have given the application
	instant-omop
		Instant OMOP will build an instance of OMOP based on your app.params file.  
		Your app.params file needs to be in the directory you are launching fhir-to-omop from.
	add-test-patients
		Adds about 1,000 test patients from synthea to your OMOP instance

Also, make sure you have an app.properties file in your working dir (the dir your in now).
