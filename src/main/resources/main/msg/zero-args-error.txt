# WELCOME TO fhir-on-omop
# --------------------------

You've successfully launched the fhir-to-omop application!
However, we need at least one correct parameter, the name of the module you would like to run.  
The following options are valid:

	// --- testing and validation
	say-hello (h)
		Echo the string "Hello world!" back to the console.
	params-example (p)
		Displays an example of what the parameters file should look like.
	my-params (m)
		Shows the parameters that the application has found for your request.  
		In other words, this echos the parameters you have given the application

	// --- fhir to omop stuff
	instant-omop (i)
		CREATE AN INSTANCE OF AN OMOP DATABASE
		Instant OMOP will build an instance of OMOP based on your app.params file.  
		Your app.params file needs to be in the directory you are launching fhir-to-omop from.
		You will need to download your terminology files from Athena before running this.  
		There is a parameter in the app.properties file that is used to point to your terminology dir
	download-patient-ids (ids)
		DOWNLOAD PATIENT IDS FROM FHIR SERVER
		This will download all of the patient ids for a fhir server.  
		A second parameter can be added to indicate how many ids should be downloaded. 
		For example, the following will download a maximum of 1000 patient ids.
		fhir-to-omop.bat ids 1000
	download (d)
		DOWNLOAD FHIR PATIENTS
		Download patients from the specified dir of FHIR patient resources.  
		Your app.params file needs to be in the directory you are launching fhir-to-omop from.
	upload (u)
		UPLOAD FHIR PATIENTS TO OMOP
		Upload patients to OMOP from the specified dir of FHIR patient resources.  
		Your app.params file needs to be in the directory you are launching fhir-to-omop from.


Also, make sure you have an app.properties file in your working dir (the dir your in now).
