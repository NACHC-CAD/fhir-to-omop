You've successfully launched the fhir-to-omop application!
However, we need at least one correct parameter, the name of the module you would like to run.  
The following options are valid:

	// --- testing and validation
	say-hello (h)
		Echo the string "Hello world!" back to the console.
	params-example (p)
		Displays an example of what the parameters file should look like.
	my-params (m)
		Shows the parameters that the application has found for your request.  
		In other words, this echos the parameters you have given the application

	// --- omop stuff
	instant-omop (i)
