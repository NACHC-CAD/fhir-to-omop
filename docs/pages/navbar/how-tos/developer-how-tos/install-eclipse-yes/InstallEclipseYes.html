		<h3>Start Developing Using _YES</h3>
		To get started navigate to the C:\_YES folder and double click on the eclipse.exe shortcut.  
		When Eclipse opens up, you should see two applications loaded into the default environment.  
		You can run the HelloWorld class to make sure everything is working.  
		
		<br/>
		<img width="800px" src="./img/hello-world.JPG" />
		<br/><br/>
		
		<br/>
		<img width="800px" src="./img/start-server.JPG" />
		<br/><br/>

		<br/>
		<img width="800px" src="./img/add-application.JPG" />
		<br/><br/>

		You can also deploy the example web application to check to see that the Wildfly web server is running.  
		You can test and debug the example web application by lauching a browser and navigating to 
		<a href="http://localhost:8080/web-security-example">http://localhost:8080/web-security-example</a>.

		<br/><br/>

		<br/>
		<img width="800px" src="./img/log-on-003.JPG" />
		<br/><br/>

		You can then use the clickable links in the console window to navigate to the server side code that is executing, 
		set break points, and debug the server side code.
