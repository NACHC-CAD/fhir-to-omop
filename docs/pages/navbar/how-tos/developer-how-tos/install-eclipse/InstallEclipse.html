			<!-- configure env -->
			<h2>Configure Your Environment</h2>
			To ensure a consistent environment, we have included as many of the dependencies as is practical.  
			You may already have some of these paths/settings configured and they don't need to be changed. 
			However, it is recommended to use these settings to ensure as much consistency as possible.  
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<!-- config path -->			
			<h3>Configure the Path Environment Variable</h3>
			Add the following to the beginning of your path
			<ul>
				<li>C:\_YES\tools\java\jdk-11.0.11\bin</li>
				<li>C:\_YES\tools\git\Git-2.27.0\bin </li>
				<li>C:\_YES\tools\mvn\apache-maven-3.6.3\bin</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<img width="400px" src="./img/path.jpg" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<!-- config java_home -->
			<h3>Configure the JAVA_HOME Environment Variable</h3>
			Add the following JAVA_HOME environment variable
			<ul>
				<li>C:\_YES\tools\java\jdk-11.0.11</li>
			</ul>
			<img width="400px" src="./img/java-home.jpg" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<!-- configure git -->
			<h3>Configure the Git SSL Certificate</h3>
			Open a cmd window and execute the following command to configure ssl for git and github access using git.  
			<pre class="prescrollable">git config --system http.sslcainfo "C:\_YES\tools\git\Git-2.27.0\mingw64\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt"</pre>
			

			<!-- launch eclipse -->

			<br/><br/>
			When Eclipse launches, you should see the HelloWorld class of the HelloWorld application included with the install.  
			There might be errors for the Lombok annotations.  Run the Maven build 
			(right click on the hello-world project on the left, select Maven->Update Project) 
			to refresh the project and these errors should resolve.  
			To run the hello-world Java application, right click anywhere on in the white space of the HelloWorld.java window 
			and select Run As->Java Application
