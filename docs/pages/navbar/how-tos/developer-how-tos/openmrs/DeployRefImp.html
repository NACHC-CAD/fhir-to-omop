			<h1>How to Build and Deploy an OpenMRS instance</h1>
			
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				OpenMRS is an opensource electronic Medical Records System. 
				(more information at <a href="https://openmrs.org">openmrs.org</a>)
				This page will show how to build and deploy an instance of OpenMRS directly to a Tomcat instance 
				(no Docker or other dependencies required). 
			</p>
			<p>
				This document walks through the process of creating a deployable instance of OpenMRS from the resources available from OpenMRS. 
				If you are just looking for a deployable version of the reference implementation created here, 
				you can just download the openmrs.war file below and deploy it to your Tomcat instance 
				by dropping it into your Tomcat's webapps folder. 
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a download href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nkp43fgteqwtclx0m6ubb/openmrs.war?rlkey=9a7uj4whpl0wgnym07u3g5h8y&dl=1">openmrs.war (prebuilt)</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Build and Deploy an OpenMRS instance</h2>
			
			<h3>Before you get started...</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Make sure the time zone for your MySql database has been set. 
					If it has not, this can easily be done by logging in as root and executing the following SQL. 
					<pre>SET GLOBAL time_zone = '+0:00';</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sure there are no artifacts in your C:\Users\&lt;my_username&gt;\Application Data\OpenMRS director. 
					Sometimes this can cause failures with strange error messages. 
					More information is available in this 
					<a href="https://talk.openmrs.org/t/question-about-errors-seen-on-install/40088">OpenMRS forum posting</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<!-- download resources -->
			
			<h3>Download the resources</h3>
			
			For this example we will be using the OpenMRS reference implementation described at 
			<a href=""></a>. 
			The original files used for this example were downloaded on August 1st 2023 from 
			<a href="https://openmrs.org/download">https://openmrs.org/download</a> and are available directly here: 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a download href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rbbudqvdf7k76gd7w9kgz/openmrs.war?rlkey=34b825bdb84ukw4f4pav0guap&dl=1">openmrs.war</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a download href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9o6drfbx64diri1hq49oy/referenceapplication-addons-2.12.2.zip?rlkey=c784k30st9g2w56pi4tsxfeub&dl=1">Reference Application</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			The files that need to be downloaded are shown below.

			<!-- unpack the resources -->
			
			<h3>Unpack the resources</h3>
			These are the files that should exist after the download.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			For this build we will need to update the WAR file with the contents of the ZIP file. 
			To do this we will need to rename the WAR file to a .zip file and then extract the contents of each. 
			After doing this you should have the files shown below. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/extracted.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p>
				We can now build the deployment by moving the .owa and .omod files from the referenceapplication-package-2.12.2 folder to the openmrs folder. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Navigate to the \referenceapplication-package-2.12.2\modules of the reference application. 
				Copy all of the files there. 
				Paste them in to the ./openmrs/WEB-INF/bundledModules folder of the openmrs directory. 
				When this is done, the bundledModules folder should look similar to what is shown below. 
			</p>
			<img src="./img/modules.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Move all of the .owa files from the reference implementation. 
				Navigate to the ./referenceapplication-package-2.12.2/owa folder. 
				Copy all of the files there. 
				Paste these files into ./openmrs/WEB-INF/bundledOwas. 
				When this is done, the bundledModules folder should look similar to what is shown below. 
			</p>
			<img src="./img/owa.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			We can now create the deployable openmrs.war file. 
			Select the files <b>with in</b> the openmrs folder and compress them to a zip file. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/compress.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Rename the resulting .zip file to openmrs.war. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/war.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Deploy the application to Tomcat by copying the newly created openmrs.war file to the webapps folder of your Tomcat instance. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/deploy.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Start Tomcat by calling catalina.bat start from the Tomcat bin folder. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/start-tom.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Starting Tomcat will take a few minutes as the openmrs application does its initial build. 
			(in this example it took about a minute and a half). 
			When Tomcat has finished starting, you should see something like what is shown below in the Tomcat window. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/tomcat-output.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/openmrs. 
			You should see something like what is shown below. 
			Log in using admin as the Username and Admin123 as the Password. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/openmrs-login.png" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			After a successful login you should see something like the following. 
			<br/>
			<img src="./img/openmrs-successful-login.png" />
			<br/>
