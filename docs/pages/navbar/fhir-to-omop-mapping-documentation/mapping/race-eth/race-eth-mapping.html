			<h1>Race and Terminology Mapping in the NACHC fhir-to-omop Tools</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			The FHIR US Core Profile uses some internally defined terminologies including a terminology for Race/Ethnicity.  
			The terminology can be found 
			<a target="terminology" href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem-cdcrec.html">
				here
			</a>.  
			The US Core Profile Implementation guide is 
			<a target="core" href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/artifacts.html">
				here
			</a>. 
			Section 10.0.7 Contains information about the terminologies used by U.S. Core including Race and Ethnicity.  
			The Race and Ethnicity code systems were downloaded as XML from 
			<a target="race-eth" href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem-cdcrec.html">
				here
			</a> as XML and the XML was converted to CSV files.  
			These CSV files were then mapped to existing OMOP codes.  
			The files used in this process are shown below.  			
			
			<h3>Data Files</h3>
