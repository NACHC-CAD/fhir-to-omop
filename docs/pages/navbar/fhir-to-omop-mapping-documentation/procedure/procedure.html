			<h1>PROCEDURE: Mapping of FHIR Procedure Resources to OMOP Entities</h1>

			<h2>Mapping Details</h2>
			<p>
				OMOP procedure records are mapped from FHIR Procedure resources. 
				Attribute level details of how FHIR Procedure resources are parsed are in the 
				<a target="parser" href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/main/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/fhir/parser/procedure/ProcedureParser.java">
					OmopProcedureBuilder
				</a>
				class.
			</p>
			<p>
				Attribute level details of how the parser is mapped to OMOP records are in the 
				<a target="builder" href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/main/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/omop/person/factory/builder/procedure/OmopProcedureBuilder.java">
					OmopProcedureBuilder
				</a>
				class.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have found FHIR Procedure resources using codes that are not procedure codes.
				These codes include codes for Measurements, Observations, and Conditions.
				The OMOP Data Quality Dashboard (DQD) tests indicated all records in the procedure table should have a procedure_concept_id
				that mapps to a concept that is in the Procedure domain (i.e. domain_id = "Procedure").
				Therefore, when Procedure FHIR resources are found that have a coding that is for a Measurement, Observation, or Condition
				these FHIR procedures are not written to the OMOP procedure table but are respetively written to the
				measurement, observation_occurrence, or condition tables.  
				The code for this is also in the 
				<a target="builder" href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/main/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/omop/person/factory/builder/procedure/OmopProcedureBuilder.java">
					OmopProcedureBuilder
				</a>
				class.
				DQD results before and after making these distinctions are shown below.
