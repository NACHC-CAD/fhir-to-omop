	<h2>2022-04-04: April 25, 2022 Status</h2>
	<p>
		Happy Monday April the 25th morning.  
		A balmy 53 degrees fahrenheit today in East Lime and it feels like spring is here to stay.  
		We are thrilled with the progress the team continues to make.  
		Since our last update we have implemented all of the core tables for our MVP implementation.  
		We have run the DQD against an upload using this implementation and have accounted for all of the failing tests.  
		We have capture these test results and published them here as part of the 
		<a href="">FHIR to OMOP Mapping Documentation</a>.  There is a separate page for each table.  
		Each of these pages gives links to the FHIR and OMOP documentation that was used to guide the mappings, 
		links to the classes implemented to parser the FHIR resources, links to the classes implemented to map the data to OMOP, 
		results from the DQD for that table, 
		and statements accounting for any failed tests.
