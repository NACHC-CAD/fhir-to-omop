	<h2>2022-04-04: April 04, 2022 Status</h2>
	<p>
		Happy Wednesday April the 4th morning.  
		Enjoying April showers at 48 degreees Fahrenheit here in East Lyme today.
		We are thrilled with the progress the team continues to make.  
		This week we've clean up the MEASUREMENT code.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Details for FHIR to OMOP mapping for MEASUREMENT are 
		<a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/fhir-to-omop-mapping-documentation/measurement/measurement.html">
			here
		</a>.  
	</p>
	Next steps include:		
	<ul>
		<li>Update Observations to pass all tests</li>
		<li>Update to visit_occurrence to pass all tests</li>
		<li>Upload of complete 1.1 million records from Synthea</li>
		<li>We are passing 98% of the Data Quality Dashboard tests as shown below.</li>
		<li>But we still have some work to do as you can see from the screen shots below.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Data Quality Dashboard Summary</h2>
	JSON from this run can be downloaded
