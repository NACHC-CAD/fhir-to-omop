	<h2>2022-03-17: March 17, 2022 Status</h2>
	Happy Thursday March the 17th morning.  
	It is a balmy 47 degrees Fahrenheit here in East Lyme, CT today and we have been getting 
	<a target="bird" href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Flicker/overview">northern flickers</a> at our bird feeders.  
	A first for us!		
	This is our very first status update!
	We are thrilled with the progress the team has made.  
	Virtually all of the work for Synthea is completed, tested, and validated.  
	Most of the work for FHIR to OMOP functionality is completed.  
	Next steps include:		
	<ul>
		<li>Synthea: Add paging to the system that fetches the /Patient/[ID]/$everything resource.</li>
		<li>OMOP: Add parsing and mapping for the procedure entity.</li>
		<li>OMOP: Refine the process to better capture measurement_type_concept_id and unit_concept_id in the measurement entity.</li>
		<li>Documentation: Add documentation for the current list of tools.</li>
		<li>We are passing 98% of the Data Quality Dashboard tests as shown below.</li>
		<li>But we still have some work to do as you can see from the measurement table screen shot below.</li>
	</ul>
