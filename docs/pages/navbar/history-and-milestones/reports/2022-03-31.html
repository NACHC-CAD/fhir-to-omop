	<h2>2022-03-31: March 31, 2022 Status</h2>
	<p>
		Happy Thursday March the 31st morning.  
		Today it's back up to 43 degrees Fahrenheit here in East Lyme, 
		but that's an outlier for the week that has been consistently in the 20's.  
		Winter hasn't given up yet!   
		We've been getting 
		<a target="bird" href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/birds/birds.html">yellow-rumped warblers</a> at our bird feeders.  
		An other first for us!		
		We are thrilled with the progress the team has made.  
		In the past few weeks we have undergone a major refactoring and the overall architecture is looking much more polished.  
		This refactoring now accounts for Patient resources represented across multiple requests (paging).  
		We've also brought all of the tests for the PROCEDURE entity to passing DQD!  
		The curve ball challenge for this feature was the accounting for FHIR using procedure, measurement, observation, and condition codes to represent procedures.  
		OMOP DQD requires all records in the procedure table to have a procedute_concept_id with a domain_id of "Procedure".  
		This was reconciled by putting FHIR procedures using measurement, observation, and condition codes into those respective tables in OMOP.

		Details for FHIR to OMOP mapping for PROCEDURE are

			here
		</a>.  
	</p>
	Next steps include:		
	<ul>
		<li>Update Measurements to pass all tests</li>
		<li>Update Observations to pass all tests</li>
		<li>Update to visit_occurrence to pass all tests</li>
		<li>Upload of complete 1.1 million records from Synthea</li>
		<li>We are passing 98% of the Data Quality Dashboard tests as shown below.</li>
		<li>But we still have some work to do as you can see from the measurement table screen shot below.</li>
	</ul>
