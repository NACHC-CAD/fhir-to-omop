			<h1>Downloading the OMOP Terminology Tables Data</h1>
			The OMOP terminology tables include the vocabulary, concept, concept_ancestor, etc. tables that define the terminologies used by your OMOP instance.  
			These tables can be populated from files that are downloaded from <a target="athena" href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/list">OHDSI Athena</a>.
			Before you can download the files you'll need to get an account.    
			
			<h1>Get an Athena account</h1>
			To get an Athena account go to the <a target="athena" haref="https://athena.ohdsi.org/auth/login">Athena Login page</a> and select the registration option. 
			Then, provide the requested information as shown in the screen shots below.

			<h1>Download Terminology Data from Athena</h1>
			After <a target="athena" haref="https://athena.ohdsi.org/auth/login">Loging into Athena</a>, go to the Download page by selecting Download option in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  
			The terminologies used as part of a basic standard install are selected.  
			The fhir-to-omop tools were built using the preselected tables with the addition of the following two terminologies.

				<li>NDFRT: The National Drug File - Reference Terminology (VA)</li>

			</ul>

			<br/>
			After submitting the request for the download you will receive an email with instructions on how to download the vocabulary package you've created.  
			You can also retrieve the vocabulary package you just created as well as other packages you've created from the <a target="athena" href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/download-history">Download History Page</a>
			<br/>
			<img align="center" width=800px; src="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/athena/athena-download.PNG" />
			<br/>
			When creation of the terminology package has completed you will receive an email that includes a list of the terminologies you've requested as well as instructions on how to finish the process.
