			<h1>Start Here: Installing and First Steps with fhir-to-omop Tools</h1>
			<p>
				This page will show you the steps to install and get started with fhir-to-omop.  <br/><br/>
				Getting started with fhir-to-omop means different things to different users.  
				The fhir-to-omop project includes several tools including utilities to download FHIR resources from a FHIR server in a highly paralleized and scalable way, tools for converting FHIR to OMOP, tools for writing data to OMOP, as well as several other tools and utilities.  
				We suggest looking at the <a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/tools/fhir-to-omop-tools-and-utilities/FhirToOmopToolsAndUtilities.html">fhir-to-omop Tools and Utilities</a> page for the functionality you are interested in.  
			</p>
			
			<!-- prerequsites -->
			<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
			<p>
				There are only three prerequisites for the entire suite of fhir-to-omop tools: An installation of Git used to download fhir-to-omop,
				an installation of Microsoft Sql Server used as the database to host the OMOP instance we will be creating, and a download of the terminology tables from <a href="">Atlas</a>.
				It is also helpful to have Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio (MSSM) installed.  Instructions for each are in the pages shown below
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/InstallGit.html">Install Git</a></li>
					<li><a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/InstallMsSqlServer.html">Install Microsoft Sql Server</a></li>
					<li><a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/DownloadTerminology.html">Download the OMOP Terminology to be used for your OMOP instance</a></li>
				</ul>
			</p>			
			
			<h1>Download and Install fhir-to-omop</h1>
			<p>
				The fhir-to-omop tools can be downloaded and installed by simply checking out the fhir-to-omop project from github using the following.
				<br/>
				<code>git clone https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop</code>
				<br/><br/>
				Then switch to the tag you want to use as shown below (kind of, you definitely do NOT want the primordial branch)
				<br/>
				<code>git checkout tags/primordial</code>
				<br/><br/>

				<br/><br/>
				This project uses tags like v0.0.0. You probably want the most recent tag.  You can find the most recent tag by going to <a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop">https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop</a>
