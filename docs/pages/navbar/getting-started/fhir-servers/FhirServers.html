						<p>
							SyntheticMass is a FHIR Patient Server that is provided by Miter.  
							Information for this server is 
							<a href="https://synthea.mitre.org/">here</a>.  
							SyntheticMass is an amazing resource that was used throughout the development of fhir-to-omop.  
						</p>
						<p>
							From their <a href="https://synthea.mitre.org/about">About</a> page:
						<p>
						</p>
							"SyntheticMass contains realistic but fictional residents of the state of Massachusetts. The synthetic population aims to statistically mirrors the real population in terms of demographics, disease burden, vaccinations, medical visits, and social determinants. SyntheticMass establishes a risk-free environment for experimenting with large-scale HL7 FHIR&copy; data."
						</p>
						<p>
							We were initially able to download approximately 1 million records in a day.  
							Since that time SyntheticMass has been throttled to limit users to 100 patients per day.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Fortunately, the SyntheticMass project has made all of their patient data available as a single download.  
							This download contains patients as FHIR resources, as well as all patients as CSV and C-CDA.  
						</p>
						<p>
							The complete SynthicMass patient population (just over 1 million patients) can be down loaded from here:
							<a download href="http://hdx.mitre.org/downloads/syntheticmass/synthea_1m_fhir_3_0_May_24.tar.gz">http://hdx.mitre.org/downloads/syntheticmass/synthea_1m_fhir_3_0_May_24.tar.gz</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							The .bat file here can be used to extract the files. 
							(Rename the source and destination files.  
							Rename the file to include a .bat extention to execute the file).
