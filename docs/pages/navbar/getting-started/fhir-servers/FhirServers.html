						<p>
							SyntheticMass is a FHIR Patient Server that is provided by Miter.  
							Information for this server is 
							<a href="https://synthea.mitre.org/">here</a>.  
							Synthiticmass is an amazing resource that was used throughout the development of fhir-to-omop.  
						</p>
						<p>
							We were initially able to download approximately 1 million records in a day.  
							Since that time SyntheticMass has been throttled to limit users to 100 patients per day.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Fortunately, the SyntheticMass project has made all of their patient data available as a single download.  
							This download contains patients as FHIR resources, as well as all patients as CSV and C-CDA.  
						</p>
						<p>
							The complete SynthicMass file can be downloaded from here:
							<a download href="http://hdx.mitre.org/downloads/syntheticmass/synthea_1m_fhir_3_0_May_24.tar.gz">http://hdx.mitre.org/downloads/syntheticmass/synthea_1m_fhir_3_0_May_24.tar.gz</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							The .bat file here can be used to extract the files. 
							Rename the source and destination files.  
							Rename the file to include a .bat extention to execute the file.
