			<h1>FHIR to OMOP</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			This document focus on the conversion of HL7 FHIR messages OMOP.  
			Specificly, this documentation will walk through the process of using the fhir-to-omop tools 
			to import FHIR resources into an instance of the OHDSI Common Data Model (CDM).  
			This example uses PostgreSql as a database. 
			This guide assumes you have a basic developer's environment that includes the prerequisites of running OHDSI on PostgrSql.  
			The following will be covered here:  
			<ul>
				<li>
					Download of all of the files required for this exercise 
					including a library of 2,500 FHIR patients and a complete instance of an OHDSI vocabulary downloaded from Athena.  
				</li>
				<li>
					Using the fhir-to-omop tools create an instance of the CDM in PostgreSql.  
				</li>
				<li>
					Creation of 2,500 patients in the CDM from FHIR resources.  
				</li>
				<li>
					Links to documentation showing the architecture of the FHIR to OMOP solution implemented here 
					including notes on overall design, 
					issues around race/ethnicity, 
					discussion of the threading model used achive processing rates of approximately 2.5 million full patient records per hour, 
					and other architectural and design considerations. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Download Resources</h2>
			<p>
				To create our 2,500 patients in OMOP from FHIR we will need the FHIR resources as well as the files to populate our vocabulary tables in the CDM.  
				These resource can be downloaded from 
				<a download href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0x1vttbaqgi7igmqlyons/fhir-to-omop.zip?rlkey=92g5uzvyuair59gml1gh4pmn4&dl=1">here</a>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				After downloading this file, unzip the contents to C:\ to create the folder C:\fhir-to-omop.  
				These files can be placed anywhere, but if you put them in C:\fhir-to-omop you will not need to make any configuration changes to complete this demo.
