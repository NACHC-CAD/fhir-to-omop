			* INTRODUCTION

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This document focus on the conversion of HL7 FHIR messages OMOP.  
				Specificly, this documentation will walk through the process of using the fhir-to-omop tools 
				to import FHIR resources into an instance of the OHDSI Common Data Model (CDM).  
				This example uses PostgreSql as a database. 
				This guide assumes you have a basic developer's environment that includes the prerequisites of running OHDSI on PostgrSql. 
				Note: the fhir-to-omop tools require Java 11.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Installing and running the fhir-to-omop tool consists of the following simple steps that will be covered in this document. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Install and Run Broadsea
				</li>
				<li>
					Download and Install (unzip) the fhir-to-omop tool
				</li>
				<li>
					Use the fhir-to-omop tool to create an OHDSI CDM and all other dependencies (run fhir-to-omop i)
				</li>
				<li>
					Use the fhir-to-omop tool to upload a set of test FHIR patients (run fhir-to-omop u)
				</li>
				<li>
					Launch Atlas to view and use our newly created OHDSI instance
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Architecture and Technical Considerations</h2>
			The following architectural and technical considerations have been documented.  
			 
			<!--

			* Highlevel Architecture

			-->
			 
			<h3>High Level Architecture</h3>
			<p>
				The FHIR to OMOP mapping part of the fhir-to-omop application uses Builder classes to represent each table in the CDM 
				and Parser objects that are used to parse FHIR resources. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, for the Observation table in the CDM mapping is done in the 
				<a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/main/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/omop/person/factory/builder/observation/OmopObservationBuilder.java">
					OmopObservationBuilder
				</a> class.  
				The OmopObservationBuilder constructs OBSERVATION Data Value Objects (DVOs) using the
				<a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/main/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/fhir/parser/observation/ObservationParser.java">
					ObservationParser
				</a> class to parse FHIR Patient resources
			</p>

			* Mapping a single FHIR objet to Multiple CDM tables and types
			*
			-->
			 
			<h3>Mapping a single FHIR objet to Multiple CDM tables and types</h3>
			<p>
				In the 2,500 synthea patients we used for testing 
				we found patterns of FHIR resources used to represent information that maps to multiple CDM tables. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, FHIR Observation resources were found to contain information that maps to 
				observation, measurement, and procedure tables in the OHDSI CDM data model.  
			</p>			 
			<p>
				Details for the mapping of the CDM observation table can be found 
				<a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/fhir-to-omop-mapping-documentation/observation/observation.html">here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<!-- 
			*
			* Concept Mapping
			*
			-->
			 
			<h3>Concept Mapping</h3>
			<p>
				The fhir-to-omop presents a complete solution to mapping system/code values in FHIR resource to OHDSI concept concept_id values.  
				All standard mappings are done by the <a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/tree/main/src/main/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/util/mapping/impl/FhirToOmopConceptMapper.java">FhirToOmopConceptMapper</a> class.  
				Race and Ethnicity mappings are a special case as FHIR has defined its own vocabulary for Race and Ethnicity
				and OMOP has defined their own vocabulary for Race and Ethnicity.  
				Race and Ethnicity are mapped using a simple mapping of these terminologies to each other as described 
				<a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/fhir-to-omop-mapping-documentation/mapping/race-eth/race-eth-mapping.html">here</a>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Details regarding concept mapping can be found 
				<a href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/fhir-to-omop-mapping-documentation/mapping/terminology/terminology-mapping.html">here</a>. 
			</p>

			<!-- 
			*
			* Threading
			*
			-->
			 
			<h3>Threading</h3>
			<p>
				It was found that Java thread pools were not sufficient to achieve the desired performance. 
				Using thread pools alone it was easy to hit the maximum cpu capabilities with a relatively small number of threads. 
				However, Java thread pools will not start the next set of threads until EVERY thread in a currently running pool is completed. 
				This resulted in the slowest process in any pool running alone before another set of threads was started. 
				This resulted in a saw-tooth performance profile: A new pool would start and maximize cpu usage. 
				As threads in this pool completed, cpu usage will fall off dramatically until only one thread was running. 
				When this final thread completed a new pool would start, the cpu utilization would be maximized, 
				and the cycle would begain again. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This behavior was defeated by essentially creating a pool of pools. 
				The technique used here allowed for the maximization of the cpu for the entire upload process 
				(except of course for the very last pool of pools). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Using this technique and the concept caching described below, we were able to achieve a rate of about
				2.5 million complete FHIR patients uploaded to our instance of the CDM in about 1 hour.
			</p>
			
			<!-- 
			*
			* Concept Caching
			*
			-->
			 
			<h3>Concept Caching</h3>
			<p>
				The most costly operation we encountered in parsing and uploading FHIR to OHDSI CDM was in mapping FHIR codes to OHDSI codes. 
				Looking up codes found in the FHIR resources was very time consuming simply due to the very large numbers of codes in these resources. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the fhir-to-omop project, we create two caches of OMOP concepts and maintain a cache of already-seen concepts. 
			</p>
			
			<!-- 
			*
			* Integration testing
			*
			-->
			 
			<h3>Integration Testing</h3>
			<p>
				The fhir-to-omop project provides extensive integration testing that can also be used to demonstrate specific functionality.  
				A <a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/test/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/RunAllIntegrationTests.java">RunAllIntegrationTests</a> 
				class is provided that will run all of the integration tests 
				and then populate the target CDM instance with the 2,500 FHIR patients using the FHIR to OMOP implementation provided here.  
			</p>			
			
			<!-- 
			*
			* Versioning
			*
			-->
			 
			<h3>Versioning</h3>
			<p>
				FHIR to OMOP integration is complicated by the existance of multiple versions of the OHDDI CDM and multiple version of FHIR. 
				The fhir-to-omop implementation presented here includes support for FHIR DTSU3 and R4. 
				This is achieved by the creation of two sets of parser classes: a DTSU3 version and an R4 version. 
				The version used is configured and can be changed at run time using a configuration file (fhir-context.txt). 
				Currently, this implementation only supports CDM 5.4.  
				The existing code base could be easily modified to use inheritance to support CDM 5.3 and 5.4 with a minimum effort.
