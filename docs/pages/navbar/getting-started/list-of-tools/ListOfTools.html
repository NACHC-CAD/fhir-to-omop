				- <a href="#get-ids">Get the IDs of the Patients on Your FHIR Server</a><br/>

			This page summarizes the tools that are available in the fhir-to-omop project to build and populate and OMOP CDM database from scratch using data from a FHIR Server.  
			All of the components used to do this are also available and can be used independently.  
			These components are listed below as Utilities.  
			These utilities include functionality such as authenticating to a FHIR server using OAUTH2 (or any other method),
			getting a list of patient ids from a FHIR server that can then be used to get patients from a FHIR server, 
			retrieving patients from a FHIR server, converting FHIR patients into OMOP CDM resources, etc.  
			The tools and Utilities listed below are currently provided publicly under the Apache 2 license by the fhir-to-omop project.  
			All of the tools listed here have a simplest complete example listed.  
			These examples are all JUnit integration tests.  
			These examples can be run individually to observe the intended behavior.  
			These tests are also run routinely as part of our build process.  
			To run these tests, follow the instructions for how to

			</a>.
			
			<!-- configuration -->
			<h2>Notes on Configuration and Testing</h2>
			All of the fhir-to-omop tools are configured using a single properties file.  
			Most of the parameters in this file are for the instance of OMOP that can be created locally by these tools.  
			Therefore, most of the parameters are all ready populated with default values.  
			A copy of this file is provided in the root directory of the fhir-to-omop.zip file created for each distribution
			(e.g. fhir-to-omop-0.0.14.zip).  
			The fhir-to-omop project maintains a robust set of JUnit integration tests that can be run individually.
			The entire JUnit test suite can be run using the 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/test/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/RunAllIntegrationTests.java">RunAllIntegrationTests</a> class.

			<h2>Notes on Design Patterns and System Architecture</h2>
			Architecture and design of the fhir-to-omop project is discussed in detail 
			<a target="arch" href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/architecture-and-design/ArchitectureOverview.html">
				here
			</a>, however there are a few key features that should be noted here.

					<th>Element</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>

				<!-- authentication -->
				<tr>
					<td>
						Authentication and Application Parameters
					</td>
					<td>
						All authentication tokens and other configurable parameters are storred in the app.properties file.  
						A (mostly) working example of this file is included in the root of the folder of the zip file that is used by application users.  
						For full functionality you will need to provide your UMLS and Synthea keys.  
						Developers can add an app.properties file to the fhir-to-omop/src/main/resources/auth folder.
						This file is excluded from our repository explicitly in .gitignore and is explicitly removed as part of the deploy build.  
					</td>
				</tr>

				<!-- data value objects -->
				<tr>
					<td>
						Data&nbsp;Value&nbsp;Objects (DVOs)
					</td>
					<td>
						<p>
							The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) tables are represented in the Java code base of fhir-to-omop as Data Value Objects (DVOs).  
							These data value objects are auto generated by querying the databases meta data and then constructing Java classes that exactly represent these tables.  
						</p>
						<p>
							The intersection between FHIR and OMOP is completely encapsulated in the OmopPersonEverything class.
							The OmopPersonEverything is constructed using and FHIR /Person/[ID]/$everything resource.
							The OmopPersonEverything then provides this resources as collections of DVOs that exactly map to OMOP tables.  
							These DVO objects can then be used to directly write data to the data base using the Dao class.
							These DVO objects can also be used to otherwise represent the data as CDM structures 
							(e.g. by writing the data to CSV files that represent the CDM tables).  
							In some cases additional information is derived from the data.  This additional data is managed using the DvoProxy class
							(which create DVO classes under the hood).  
							Details for the OmopPersonEverything and OmopPersonEverythingFactory are listed in the Utilities section below.

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			The fhir-to-omop tools are the more complete solutions that perform complex tasks.
			Things like creating an entire OMOP instance including populated vocabulary tables from scratch.  
			Things like populating an OMOP instance with the entire contents of a FHIR Patient server.

			<h1>Utilities</h1>
			The fhir-to-omop utilities are the building blocks of the fhir-to-omop environment.  
			These tools can be used individually.
			Each tool has a simplest complete example that exists as a JUnit integration test in the fhir-to-omop project.  
			This integration test is listed at the bottom of the description for each entry in the list below.  
			<p>
				Utilities documentation is forthcoming.
