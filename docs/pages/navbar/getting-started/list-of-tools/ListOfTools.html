			<h1>List of fhir-to-omop Tools and Utilities</h1>
			The tools an Utilities listed below are currently provided publicly under the Apache 2 license by the fhir-to-omop project.  
			All of the tools listed here have a simplest complete example listed.  
			These examples are all JUnit integration tests.  
			These examples can be run individually to observe the intended behavior.  
			These tests are also run routinely as part of our build process.  
			To run these tests, follow the instructions for how to 
			<a target="developer" href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/use-fhir-to-omop/UseFhirToOmopAsADeveloper.html">
				use fhir-to-omop as a developer
			</a>.
			
			<!-- configuration -->
			<h2>Notes on Configuration and Testing</h2>
			All of the fhir-to-omop tools are configured using a single properties file.  
			Most of the parameters in this file are for the instance of OMOP that can be created locally by these tools.  
			Therefore, most of the parameters are allready populated with default values.  
			A copy of this file is provided in the root directory of the fhir-to-omop.zip file created for each distribution
			(e.g. fhir-to-omop-0.0.14.zip).  
			The fhir-to-omop project maintains a robust set of JUnit integration tests that can be run individually.
			All of the Synthea tests can be run using the 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/test/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomopsynthea/RunAllSyntheaIntegrationTests.java">RunAllSyntheaIntegrationTests</a> class.
			All of the OMOP tests can be run using the 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/blob/main/src/test/java/org/nachc/tools/fhirtoomop/RunAllOmopIntegrationTests.java">RunAllOmopIntegrationTests</a> class.
			The entire JUnit test suite can be run using the

			<h2>Notes on Design Patterns and System Architecture</h2>
			Architecture and design of the fhir-to-omop project is discussed in detail 
			<a target="arch" href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/architecture-and-design/ArchitectureOverview.html">

				<!-- authentication -->
				<tr>
					<td>
						Authentication and Application Parameters
					</td>
					<td>
						All authentication tokens and other configurable parameters are storred in the app.properties file.  
						A (mostly) working example of this file is included in the root of the folder of the zip file that is used by application users.  
						For full functionality you will need to provide your UMLS and Synthea keys.  
						Developers can add an app.properties file to the fhir-to-omop/src/main/resources/auth folder.
						This file is excluded from our repository explicitly in .gitignore and is explicitly removed as part of the deploy build.

						<p>
							The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) tables are represented in the Java code base of fhir-to-omop as Data Value Objects (DVOs).  
							These data value objects are auto generated by querying the databases meta data and then constructing Java classes that exactly represent these tables.  
						</p>
						<p>
							The intersection between FHIR and OMOP is completely encapsulated in the OmopPersonEverything class,
							which is created by the OmopPersonEverythingFactory class.
							The OmopPersonEverything is constructed using and FHIR /Person/$everything resource.
							The OmopPersonEverything then provides this resources as collections of DVOs that exactly map to OMOP tables.  
							These DVO objects can then be used to directly write data to the data base using the Dao class.
							These DVO objects can also be used to otherwise represent the data as CDM structures 
							(e.g. by writing the data to CSV files that represent the CDM tables).  
							Details for the OmopPersonEverything and OmopPersonEverythingFactory are listed in the Utilities section below.

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			The fhir-to-omop tools are the more complete solutions that perform complex tasks.
			Things like creating an entire OMOP instance including populated vocabulary tables from scratch.  
			Things like populating an OMOP instance with the entire contents of a FHIR Patient server.  
			
			<h2>Utilities</h2>
			The fhir-to-omop utilities are the building blocks of the fhir-to-omop environment.  
			These tools can be used individually.
			Each tool has a simplest complete example that exists as a JUnit integration test in the fhir-to-omop project.  
			This integration test is listed at the bottom of the description for each entry in the list below.

						<p>
							Get an OAUTH2 token from the Synthea patient server.  
						</p>
						<p>
							The SyntheaOauth tool gets an OAUTH token from the Synthea Patient server used as a reference implementation for the fhir-to-omop tool suite.  
							There seems to be some variation in how OAUTH authentication is done from server to server.  
							This class works for the Synthea Patient server we use here and may or may not work with other servers.

							Example: The

						FHIR: FhirPatientEverythingFetcher
					</td>
					<td>
						Get a Patient/[ID]/$everything resource from any FHIR Patient server.  
						<br/><br/>
						<p>
							The FhirPatientEverythingFetcher is used to get the JSON string representing all of the information the server has for a given patient.  
							Although it is intended to be used for any FHIR server, there does seem to be differences in the way FHIR Patient servers implement authentication.  
							In our simplest complete example, we are using a Synthea Patient server and the SyntheaOauth tool to generate the token needed for the request.  
							Getting an account and credentials required to get this token are described in our list of 
							<a target="start-here" href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/StartHere.html">prerequisites</a>.
						</p>

							The tool requires these parameters
