			<h1>List of fhir-to-omop Tools and Utilities</h1>
			The tools an Utilities listed below are currently provided publicly under the Apache 2 license by the fhir-to-omop project.  
			
			<!-- tools -->
			<h2>Tools</h2>
			The fhir-to-omop tools are the more complete solutions that perform complex tasks.
			Things like creating an entire OMOP instance including populated vocabulary tables from scratch.  
			Things like populating an OMOP instance with the entire contents of a FHIR Patient server.  
			
			<h2>Utilities</h2>
			The fhir-to-omop utilities are the building blocks of the fhir-to-omop environment.  
			These tools can be used individually.
			Each tool has a simplest complete example that exists as a JUnit integration test in the fhir-to-omop project.  
			This integration test is listed at the bottom of the description for each entry in the list below.

						FhirPatientEverythingFetcher
					</td>
					<td>
						Get a Patient/[ID]/$everything resource from any FHIR Patient server.  
						The FhirPatientEverythingFetcher is used to get the JSON string representing all of the information the server has for a given patient.  
						Although it is intended to be used for any FHIR server, there does seem to be differences in the way FHIR Patient servers implement authentication.  
						In our simplest complete example, we are using a Synthea Patient server and the SyntheaOauth tool to generate the token needed for the request.  
						Getting an account and credentials required to get this token are described in our list of 
						<a target="start-here" href="/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/getting-started/start-here/StartHere.html">prerequisites</a>.
						The tool requires three parameters
						<ul>
							<li>The URL of the FHIR Patient Server</li>
							<li>The ID of the Patient</li>
							<li>An OAUTH2 token (this can be generated for the Synthea server using the SyntheaOauth tool)</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>
						Example: FhirPatientEverythingIntegrationTest
						The <a href="">FhirPatientEverythingIntegrationTests</a> gives a simplest complete example of the use of this tool.
