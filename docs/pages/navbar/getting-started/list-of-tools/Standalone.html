			<h2>How to Get NACHC fhir-to-omop Standalone Application</h2>
			<p>
				The NACHC fhir-to-omop is packaged as a zip file with each release.  
				The latest version can be downloaded by going to the 
				<a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/fhir-to-omop/releases">releases</a> page 
				and clicking on the link for the fhir-to-omop zip file link for the latest release.  
				(you will probably need to expand the drop-down for the Assets)
			</p>
			<img src="./img/releases.jpg" />
			<h2>Contents of the zip file</h2>
			<p>
				After you've downloaded the zip, unzip the file.  
				The zip file contains the following:
				<ul>
					<li><b>lib:</b> A folder containing all of the dependencies for the application</li>
					<li>
						<b>app.properties:</b> 
						The app.properties file that has all of the configuration information for the application. 
						The version of the file provided here includes everything required to create a default instnace 
						except for the connection information for the FHIR server will use to get patients.  
					</li>
					<li><b>fhir-to-omop.bat:</b> A bat file that calls the Java code. This is the bat file you will call to access the application.  </li>
					<li><b>fhir-to-omop.jar</b> The jar file that contains the fhir-to-omop Java classes.  </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<img src="./img/dir.JPG" />
			<h2>Using the Application</h2>
			<p>
				The application is called by calling the bat file using the parameter for the desired action.  
				The download ids call allows for a second parameter that will limit the number of patient IDs downloaded by the application.  
				Each call has a long version of the parameter and a short version.  
				All of the function of the application can be seen by simply calling the bat file without any parameters.
