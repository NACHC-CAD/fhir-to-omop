			<h1>Sluggo</h1>
			Meet Sluggo.  We are inspired by Sluggo because he keeps moving forwards no matter what.
			Even when it feels like there might be a slow train coming.  
			Especially when if feels there might be a slow train coming.  
			Sluggo might not be the fastest guy out there but he keeps going, no matter what.  
			He will walk the rails for as long as it takes for that hard road to lead him to today.  
			We love Sluggo and hope that the photographer who took this picture took him off of this track and put him on the right track (metaphorically speaking).

			<h1>Shelly</h1>
			Meet Shelly the shoe billed stork.  We are inspired by Shelly as she soars majestically over all obstacles that get in her way.  
			We love her even if she is a bit introverted and obstinately determined at times by nature.  
			We know she has worked hard to overcome the negative parts of this nature and has embraced the positive aspects.  
			She evenly weathers all storms with a graceful optimism as seen in <a target="shelly" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VriRLP8Fz0">this video</a> (that might haunt your dreams).
