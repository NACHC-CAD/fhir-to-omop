							<b>Northern Flicker:</b> Seen in East Lyme, CT in early March.  
							Northern Flickers are large, brown woodpeckers with a gentle expression and handsome black-scalloped plumage. 
							On walks, don't be surprised if you scare one up from the ground. 
							It's not where you'd expect to find a woodpecker, but flickers eat mainly ants and beetles, 
							digging for them with their unusual, slightly curved bill. 
							When they fly you'll see a flash of color in the wings -
							yellow if you're in the East, red if you're in the West - and a bright white flash on the rump. 
							At least that's what it says
