Things that commonly go awry with GitDocs
- <b>Have and index.html file in each folder</b>Each folder in the docs directory needs a file called index.html (for some unknown reason)
- <b>Do NOT start folder names with an underscore ("_")</b>Gitdocs does NOT like folder names that start with an underscore (this only cost me about 2 hours of my life, I'm getting better at this)
- <b>Relative References</b>Gitdocs seems to only like relative urls (./pages/header and pages/header works but /pages/header does not)
